            <h4>Mark Carneiro</h4>
            <p>After I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, I found that the simplest of meals affected me adversely. I
                decided to see a dietitian that would me with my diet while my body healed. Shilpa Joshi, RD was highly
                recommended by a well-renowned doctor. As I got to know Shilpa, I began to realize the depth of her
                knowledge about nutrition, diet, and exercise. She has a strong desire to find different ways to help
                patients be healthier and to solve difficult health problems. I was impressed with her drive to find
                holistic, healthy ways to help our bodies heal and to prevent further problems. With Shilpa’s program I
                learned how to understand the food I eat and how my body works with this food. Shilpa did not restrict
                my eating habits but showed me how to read labels and introduce healthier things into my diet. I am
                grateful to Shilpa for having helped me on my path to recovery. I would highly recommend consulting
                Shilpa Joshi, RD for all your dietary needs.</p>

            <h4>Dr. Nishita Rana</h4>
            <p>Shilpa Joshi, RD is a highly knowledgeable Dietician. She has been guiding me from past two years for peg
                tube feeding. Very few Dieticians can give their best advice about peg feeding on opd basis. Her
                knowledge about nutrition, diet in relation to tube feeding patients is highly appreciable. Her
                recommendations would mainly focus on balanced diet, proper calorie counts and home preparations as much
                as possible. Thank you for keeping us on healthy track!</p>

            <h4>Dipti Raut</h4>
            <p>
                I am Dipti Raut from Mumbai, I used to be 92 kg. Health issues were my primary reason and hence I
                decided to lose weight. Firstly I consulted dietician so that I could plan a proper diet. And I was so
                lucky that I got the best dietician, who helps you to lose weight by making you eat and stay healthy,
                thanks a lot Shilpa Joshi, RD ma'am. Along with gym sessions, I also started reducing carbohydrates in
                my diet. I lost weight gradually but steadily and went down to 72kg. I think what worked is a
                combination of sustained and regular exercise with a healthy diet. It was not a miracle but my
                discipline and support from family, dietician, and friends that yielded results. Hard work with true
                dedication is always rewarded with delicious fruit.</p>
